# PingPing-Game
This is a PingPong Game I have created using Python 3.9 and in the PyCharm IDE.<br />
I used the Kivy module to create the game.<br />
The game works by clicking on the paddles to hit the ball. <br />
Everytime the opponent misses the ball you get a single point. <br />
The game incorporates custom fonts and images to make it more aesthetically pleasing.<br />
There is a sample video attached to see how the game functions. <br />
